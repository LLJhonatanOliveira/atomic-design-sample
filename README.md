## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
npm install
```
## Usage
This project follows Atomic Design principles, consisting of three main types of components:

Atoms: Smallest UI elements like buttons and text inputs.
Molecules: Combinations of atoms, such as a text input with buttons.
Organisms: Complex components that can include molecules and atoms, like a list with pagination.
You can import and use these components in your React applications as needed.

## Starting Storybook
Starting Storybook
Storybook is set up for visual testing and development of the components. To start Storybook, run the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
This will open Storybook in your default browser, allowing you to interact with the components and see how they behave with different props.
